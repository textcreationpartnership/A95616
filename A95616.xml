            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Let us (then) break off our ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, and rouze our ſelves up, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the perilous bancks of our Sea, and the falſe viſions of our night. If we farther grope in the dark, and creep into corners, to redouble our obſcurity, if our ſpirits continue to embrace the impure Mud of this gloomy earth, it is to be (more than) feared, that the infection of this peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aire, altogether converts our glimmering into blindneſſe, and our ſtupidity, into a continual lethargy of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>The ſtrength of the Poyſon which the world vomits againſt us, is ſubtile, and peirſing: in one inſtant charming our ſpirits, inchanting our ſenſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving us of Reaſon, and ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing us loſt.</p>
            <p>This World treats us, as the Torpille with the other Fiſhes;<note place="margin">The Cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</note> ſhe breaths upon them, ſhe freezes them, ſhe ſtiffens them, ſhe lulls them aſleep, and then devoures them. Her touch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of ſenſe, as that of the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard the Scorpion. The blaſt of her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170524:16"/>mouth is not leſſe fatal to us, than that of the Baſalisk, who rends the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hearts, by the ſweetneſſe of her ſofiſticated beauty, ſhe deprives us of our time, to the intent to make us plunge our ſelves to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her deſignes, and compels us to accept of apparances inſtead of truths, and to cauſe us to ſtraggle and ſteere irregularly, even unto ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</p>
            <p>But we may not for ever ſtageer and float at the mercy of all theſe blaſts, it behoves us to fix our ſliding ſteps, and to ſuſtain our ſtomacks with ſome wholſome nouriſhment. We are created to aſpire above the Sunne, and Moon: the earth is too baſe to be our end, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite we have an object more rich, more high.</p>
            <p>Our ſpirits may not ever be fixt and anchored within this body: It behoveth that ſhe languiſh after, that ſhe raiſe her ſelf up to a more ſoveraign ſtation, toward a more abſolute fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
            <p>Let us (then) rend off the muffer that hood-winks our eyes, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170524:17"/>contemplate on the condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are, to the end we may obſerve how we runne (with the multitude) to our deſtruction: it will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable task to kindle the lamp to enlighten our obſcurity, and direct our ſelves ſafely, to the end we ſtraggle not more, in the Deſarts of the World.</p>
            <p>We ſhall have obtain'd no ſmall advantage, when we have chaſt away thoſe clouds which obſcure the Sunne, and leaves us (like flowers) langniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſhadow, when we ſhall call to mind the traiterous hooks of falſe delights: when we ſhall have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the otion of our deſigns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which render us ſlaves to thoſe things, were created for us and for our uſe.</p>
            <p>O how happily ſhall that houre be employed, in which we ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how the fleſh precipitates the ſoul, how it's deſires ſtifle it, how it conſtraines that divine part to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way it's Scepter, to render it ſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to offend it's dignity, and to be ſubſervient to corruptible things: Inſtead whereof, ſhe, (without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170524:17"/>ceaſing) ought to raiſe her ſelf up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven, where her inheritance is, and whether all her deſignes ſhould tend! Aſſuredly, this day ſhall be bleſſed for us, wherein (having chaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all thoſe follies which poſſeſſe and maſter our ſpirits, and in which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received force to ſurmount and vanquiſh all our paſſions,) we ſhall call to mind that our repoſe is in a higher Region than the earth: That this world ſhould not ſerve us for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a paſſage to mount up to heaven, that it ought to be our way, not our end: That whil'ſt we ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ here, we ſhould ever elevate our thoughts on high, toward him who diſpoſeth the ever moving heaven, and governs the erting courſes of the wandring Starres: who ſuſtaineth the earth without trouble, and containes in his hands, the ſeaſons, the ages, and winds, as ſervants to his will. Our conſcience, and the care of our ſafety oblidge us: the ſound of his omnipotent voice which ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes dayly here below, adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us; crying, that it is time to think of it, and preſſeth us unto it. But our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170524:18"/>deſigns ſhrivel in the bud, theſe Divine ſeeds ſo ſoon as they begin to ſpring in our ſoules, and we are ſo feeble that thoſe motions which we direct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, are check't in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; They appear a little, and are ſuddenly diſſipated, vaniſhing like lightning.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider a little with our ſelves, let us free our feet from this ſubtile laborinth, let us (for ſome time) diſaſſociate our ſpirits from the body, let us go out of our ſelves, let us for a while abandon the man; and ſo retiring, we ſhall evidently behold the confuſion of thoſe deſigns, and the deformity of thoſe councels that poſſeſſe humanity.</p>
            <p>Behold he embraceth more than he can retain, his greedineſſe is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of moderation, he engageth in more buſineſſe than he can perfect. It's a perpetual motion without ſtay, without end.</p>
            <p>His deſires follow him, and produce each other: abandoning one gulf, he enters another: The World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates him, one deſigne as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is extinguiſht. He is ever clam'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170524:18"/>and choak't up, and reſembles thoſe unconſtant leaves, who as oft ſhift place, as the aire changes the wind.</p>
            <p>One hope enchants him, which afterward proves vain, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he throwes himſelf upon another, which incontinently vaniſheth away in a dreame:<note place="margin">Fr. Pro.</note> His counters are found lyars, there is (without ceaſing) a miſreckoning in his Cipher. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſſity of one paſſion aſſaults him, and ſuddenly he is tranſported with a new deſire.</p>
            <p>We are ever giddy-headed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes troubled, continually penſive, and that under a hope of an uncertain and periſhing good; for the price of a handful of winde, for a mortal thing, which every moment, ſlideth and ſlippeth out of his hands: for the obtaining of that, which cannot ſtop the haſty flight of his yeares, which cannot prolong his life one breath, nor can it prevent that his ſongs be not changed into Plaints, his dayes into darkneſſe, his pleaſures into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</p>
            <p>O how much more expedient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170524:19"/>were it for him that this violence and deſire would employ it ſelf upon the contempt of what he ſo ardently embraceth: and that inſtead of his groveling on the earth, dazled with it's vain ſplendor, he would erect his face toward that ſacred ſource, whence ſprings his life. There ſhould he draw waters, (more than ſufficient) to ſatisfie the thirſt of his ſcorch't throat: and having his eares raviſh't with the harmony of the pleaſant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of that purling ſtreame, no path ſhould ſeem rough to him. The fruitful Rivers of this Divine Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dilating over him, and (by an ample Deluge) happily choaking all thoſe cares that would approach him.</p>
            <p>The truth (ever by him) would diſpell all imaginations that would torment him, poſſeſſing him with the real enjoyments of thoſe celeſtial delights, which he onely knowes by ſight: and from that eminency would ſhew him the follies of men, and thoſe winds which toſſe and threaten their veſſels in this turbulent Sea, diſcovering to him the perils of others without running their fortune.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170524:19"/>
            <p> Truly his eſtate would be marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly changed, his condition would be extreamly bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But can we not follow this Trace? is this place unacceſſible to us? Let's try, let us divert our ſelves a little from the World, let us ſearch out the ready way to conduct us unto ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſo delightful a habitation.</p>
            <p>If our paſſions heat us, let us runne to theſe waters, let's extinguiſh this conflagration.

            <p>He alwayes deſires, he ever feares: his deſires are a fire that conſumes him, his fears an ice that chills him. And among the infinite multitude of Worldlings, that are there aſſembled, there is not one alone that is content with his fortune, with his condition, nor which maketh the leſſe queſt for the ſatisfaction of his proper inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>All take one remedy for another, for to cure their griefs, they endeavour to loſe the ſenſe of them: they adminiſter to themſelves poyſon for antidotes, and death for life.

            <p>They ſearch for reſt in that toyle which conſumes them, like to the Torch which diminiſheth by degrees, feeding it ſelf of it's Loſſe and living on it's Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
            <p>They are gray in the flower of their youth. The whole life of the moſt happy among them, is nothing but a puniſhment, but a continual paſſion, but pain, but vexation, which ever attends them till it hath over-turned them into their Sepulchres.</p>

            <p>When he poſſeſſeth the wealth and treaſures of the earth, the care of it doth not faile to accompany his wretched ſteps. His deſire hath no limits, he findes nothing that ſtayes it: it ſtill encreaſeth with the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wealth.</p>

Poor and blind man! thou obſerveſt not how thou plungeſt thy ſelf into the water after thoſe ſuperfluous and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing things: that the defect is not in thy wealth, but in thy ſpirit: that by how much the more thou augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy treaſures, by ſo much art thou laid open to the ſtroakes of adverſity.</p>

            <p>That which men enterprize againſt heaven, he cauſeth to recoyle upon them.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſtriketh againſt God, he will there finde ſuch ſolidity, that the repercuſſion will tumble him down ſhattred like an earthen Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever precipitates himſelf into that encounter, there ſinks, and (ordinarily) periſhes, before that he hath enterpriz'd it.</p>

            <p>Let's not expect till (for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) his arme fall heavy upon us, till he trouble and conſume us, as ſlaves of iniquity and of Satan.</p>
            <p>The Maſter that is not obey'd by his ſervants, but outraged out of ſpight and contempt, will not he break up his Family from whence he reaps nought but vexation? So, the

He is Juſt, he is Omnipotent, his power marcheth equal pace with his pleaſure: he will cruſh his enemies, he will terryfie them after ſuch a ſort, as to diſable them to Rally or reunite, he will cauſe them to tremble under his ſword, as eares of corne under the ſiccle: their bodyes (torne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd with wounds) ſhall be a pray to ſalvage beaſts, they ſhall ſerve as food for Ravens: he will inflict on the children, the rigour of his revenging lawes, for their fathers offences: he will puniſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in the Race, who ſhall ſhrivel and fade with a ſhameful brand on the brow of the Nephewes: and in vain would men ward his blows, in vain will they ſly before his face.</p>

            <p>Let all the ungodly rally them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, let them aſſemble, he would deſtroy them at one ſtroak, he would reduce them into one handful of aſhes,<note place="margin">☞</note> into nothing, ſuch is his force, that he can vanquiſh his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not onely overturne them, but entice and dragge them and their Armies, and tumble them (for ever) head-long into the gulph of darkneſſe, belching with fire, and carcaſſes fil'd with deſpaires, and horrours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhall be tormented without intermiſſion, without having a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of yeares of exquiſite torments, to be eſteemed as one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point of eternity; in which they ſhall languiſh, ſuffer, and endure perpetually with rage, the racks, the flames, and what ever can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dreadful.</p>

            <p>Then Lord, he whom thou haſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170524:69"/>raiſed up by thy right hand, for a Prince and Saviour to give repentance unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> and remiſſion of ſinnes, appeared in the fleſh, that ſo the fleſh might live, and by his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thy Clemency might approach us, which before was with-drawn; Thou haſt ſent him as a Bright Sun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all the compaſſe of the Earth.</p>
            <p>He appeared cloathed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, but all repleat, and all ſhining with Divinity. The Power of His Vertue was manifeſt to the eyes of all the people. The moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſtormes and billowes of the Ocean, gave way unto the ſole power of His word. The tempeſtuous whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Men, captiv'd under the power of the Devil, were enlarged, with the onely glance of His eye: The moſt inveterate maladies departed at the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170524:69"/>only touch of His garment: and the bodies mouldering; under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Coffin, roſe again at his voyce in the Tombe.</p>
            <p>His life was nothing but an open Book of Doctrine, with a multitude of miracles and favours toward men; The limits of his Courſe were ſo pleaſant, they were ſo bright, with the beames of his compaſſion; ſo glittering with his triumphs over the enemy of men. The Hiſtory is therein ſo rich, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe takes away and obſtructs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. <hi>And that the world</hi> (as ſaith his Beloved Apoſtle) <hi>is not ſufficient to contain that which might be written.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Alſo Lord, He came to ſtifle (by the impetuoſity of his power, and by the grandure of his merit) our curſed enemy, and to cut off the ſtreame of the courſe of his puiſſance, flying through the world:</p>
            <p>He came as a great Royal Eagle from the heighth of heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend on the earth: and in favour of his own to ſcatter (with the onely ayre of his vigerous clapping of his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170524:70"/>wings) all the ſtrength of Satan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his encounter.</p>
            <p>He came as the Evening, and cloſe of our miſeries, and dawning of our felicity: as the bright Sunne of men to comfort and ſtrengthen them by his wholſome and pleaſant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>He came as the morning, which chaſeth away the night, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, declaring the returne of the light: as the holy Columbe of the world, the ſolid pillar of the heavens, the lively image of his charity, and the divine foot-ſteps which giveth life. And finally my God, thy Chriſt our Saviour, being upon the point to die, would that the laſt act of his life, ſhould be the inſtitution of the Holy Sacrament of his body, which he celebrated in the company of his Apoſtles: declaring unto them, that all they who firmly believe in him, ſhall have remiſſion of their ſinnes; in the effuſion of this blood, and ſhall for ever poſſeſſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven; and to conferre on us an infallible aſſurance, he elected (for a ſeal and witneſſe of his laſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170524:70"/>will,) bread and wine: to the intent that the faithful (by theſe ſignes) ſhould be aſcertained of the treaſures which are acquired for them by his bounty.</p>
            <p>But my Great God. 'Tis now that we muſt commemorate the excellent Sermon made to the Diſciples, for to inſtruct them and to render them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the participation of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament.</p>
            <p>'Tis here expedient to call to mind the words of him, which thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't with thy voyce in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in the hearing of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>James,</hi> and Saint <hi>John, this is my well-beloved Sonne, hear him;</hi>

For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed: he who eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the Father, who is living, hath ſent me, and I live by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170524:71"/>the Father: So he who eateth me, Shall live alſo by me. That is the bread which deſcended from heaven, not as your fathers have eaten Manna, and are dead: who eateth this bread, ſhall live for ever. He ſpake theſe things in the Synagogue, teaching in Capernaum: But knowing that many of his Diſciples found</hi> this <hi>ſaying hard, he added, doth this offend you?</hi> what <hi>will you do then if you ſhall behold the Sonne of man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there, where he was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? 'Tis the Spirit that quickens, the fleſh is unprofitable: the words which I ſpeak to you, are ſpirit and life.</hi> And after he had finiſh't theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he made them partakers of his Holy Supper, even as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the hand of his bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
            <p>In the night wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, <hi>He took bread, and having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks, he broke it, and ſaid, take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you, do this in remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo after Supper, he took the Cup, ſaying, this Cup is the New Teſtament of my blood, do this in remembrance of me. For how often, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170524:71"/>whenſoever you ſhall eat of this bread, and drink of this Cup, you ſhall ſhew forth my death even untill I come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the end Lord, his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Charity, and (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all admiration) having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the hour: wherein (by his death,) he would redeem our lives, he became the ſaving hand which broke and oppoſed the blow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſmart of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>And be who was able as a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap of heaven to overturne under his Tempeſt the higheſt Mountaines: who could as a whirle-poole ſwallow all in an inſtant that oppoſed this power; and as a whirle-wind ſweep away all that was on the earth: He ſaid I, who by the force of his Arme with one ſmall motion can deſtroy all humane ſoules, and with one onely glance of his Eye, arme a million of Angels, and overthrow under his feet the heaven and the earth, ſubmitted himſelf to the rage and brutiſhneſſe of his people; adopted above all people, the firſt-born among men: and whom thou defendeſt as the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170524:72"/>Apple of thine eye. He permitted them to extend his members on the Croſſe, to waſh our ſins in his blood, and in that flood which the Iron made to iſſue from his body.</p>
            <p>And thus, great God, Thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son gave his life a ranſome for us, and delivered us from the curſe of the law, which had ſo long time held us ſlaves to ſin.</p>
            <p>He offer'd his body in ſacrifice, and by that holy oblation, acquir'd for us the gifts and the fulneſſe of his graces wherein the bleſſed ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejoyce.</p>
            <p>'Tis this Chriſt who is worthy to take the Book of life,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5.9.</note> and to open the ſeals thereof.</p>
            <p>'Tis he who is the Lambe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5.12:</note> who meriteth to receive power, ſtrength, Honour, and Praiſe.</p>
            <p>His death was the ſacrifice of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the accompliſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all ceremonyes, which have been from the beginning of the world.</p>
            <p>This is the ſacrifice without renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby the wrath of God is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appeaſ'd, his juſtice ſatisfied,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170524:72"/>and the tranſgreſſions of men ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac't.</p>
            <p>'Tis that bright ſhining ſacrifice in compariſon whereof the foregoing were but obſcure ſhadowes.</p>
            <p>This is the only ſacrifice full of Majeſty, which is alone the object of all ſacrifices, offered in time-paſt by all people adoring the true God. All that which the oblations of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and of our fathers, have had of Propitiation and of ſweet Odour were anticipated on the fulneſſe of grace, and on the infinite merit of this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſo often made in all foregoing ages.</p>
            <p>This is the eternal ſacrifice, fill'd with lively ſplendour, which darts his Rayes, and confers his Balme up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his, to render them a ſweet Odour before thee my God.</p>
            <p>This is the ſacrifice which hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them on the ſacred ſeat of the Church, and hath carryed them into the glorious Temple of the legitimate Spouſe of Chriſt, all Glittering with Divinity.</p>
            <p>'Tis my God this ſacrifice which hath conferred thy love on me, which

            <p>Alſo, my God, there was nothing but the puiſſant and victorious hand of thy Sonne, which could ſever the cords and the entangling which held us bound in the ſnares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
            <p>There was none but he alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for ſo great an enterprize, He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who hath drawn us out of the path and ſlaughter of death, to fill us with Triumphs.</p>
            <p>He alone, who is the Phaire and the Lanthorne who directs us to arive in a ſafe harbour, and who hath ever his eyes open for our happineſſe, and watcheth over our affictions.</p>
            <p>He alone, who is the channel of perpetual ſweetneſſe, which unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly diſtills on them who caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Port of thy Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</p>
            <p>Great God, The compaſſe of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170524:73"/>Univerſs adores thy Grandure: but as the glory of thy chiefeſt benefits, are perpetually graved in the hearts of thy faithfull ones, in whom (by this holy ſacrifice) thou haſt planted thy victorious lawrels: Alſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that I be the Temple in which for ever there may be chanting and ſounding forth the Hymnes of thy Triumphs: and that thou may'ſt be the ſole object of my heart, as thou art the cauſe of my repoſe: and the end of my vowes, as thou art the Redeemer and Conſerver of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what more beautyfull object my God, can I enjoy then for ever to contemplate, that Chriſt is the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable wall and Rampart of my life: and that his charity heated with his watchfulneſſe over me, cauſeth, (without intermiſſion) to ſpring in thy compaſſions new ſprouts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion? This is the true Father of men, who tranſported with the love of his children, is offered for them in ſacrifice, and hath embraced their ſorrowes, and his death.</p>
            <p>Up then, my ſoul, let thy thoughts be raviſh't in the contemplation of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170524:74"/>this holy light of the world, who ſhineth over the heaven and the earth, and enlightneth with his flame the gloomineſſe of our moſt obſcure night.</p>
            <p>Up, admire his compaſſion, adore this Lamb without ſpot, that holy Burnt-offering, that eternal high Prieſt, who hath given himſelf for thee.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce thou oh my ſoul, ſince thy clenſing is ſo perfect and ſo pure, ſince the merit of that death ſhall carry thee into the heavens.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt not my ſoul,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> one of thoſe Sacrificers which are ſubject unto death, made after the law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment, who have need to offer continual ſacrifices: firſt, for their own ſinnes, then for thoſe of the people: Thou haſt one Sovereign high Prieſt, made according to the power of an uncorruptible life, and who hath one perpetual oblation, one holy Prieſt, Innocent, ſeparate from ſinnes, exalted far above all heavens, who is conſecrated for ever, offering himſelf once, to obtaine an eternal redemption.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:170524:74"/>
            <p> The light of the world (my ſoul) chaſeth the night and obſcurity farre from thee: but the knowledge of this ſacrifice diſſipateth all darkneſſe from thy eyes, and renders thee capable (happily) to finiſh thy courſe on earth, and attain (with joy) an aboad in Paradice.</p>
            <p>Divine Trinity: the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſalvation, Holy unity of three perſons, in whom conſiſteth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and felicity, whereof my ſoul can be render'd capable: Grant me that I may worthily comprehend the majeſty of this ſacrifice, and that all the dayes of my life, I may medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on its greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>Lord, the Lamb is ſlain from the beginning of the world: and both our fathers and we our ſelves have waſhed in one ſame blood, and are redeemed by the ſame ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>'Tis what the Apoſtle ſaith, our fathers were all under the cloud,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1.</note> and have all paſſed throw the Sea, and were all baptized in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and have all eaten of one and the ſame ſpiritual food, and have all dranke of one

            <p>For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So, Lord, the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> have eaten and drank the ſame ſpiritual ſubſtance with us, and have participated as we of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>The word Prophetick and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, have the ſame efficacy: Chriſt in the one and the other throw all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Their Sacraments giving them Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to come, to aſſume hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh, and ſuffer for their ſins: and ours give to us the Saviour of the world, come, having taken fleſh of the Virgin, endured the Croſſe, and riſen for our Juſtification: The Manna and the water ſignified to them their future redemption, and the bread and wine ſignifie to us the ſatisfaction of our Randſome acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, come, dead, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, after ſuch a ſort that we have but one like, and ſame faith under divers ſignes.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170524:75"/>
            <p> Chriſt the only ſalvation of the Church, in all its periods, without the law, under the law, and under Grace.</p>
            <p>He is prefigured in all the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, exhibited in all Sacraments; as well Old as New, which are (in all times) unprofitable without Chriſt, which is himſelf alone both the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and the ſuſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw the day of the Lord, and rejoyc't: This great ſecret was revealed unto the Prophets who Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't it through the world: they were the ſignes of ſalvation to come,<note place="margin">Or Hoſt</note> and of the holy Bread which ſhould be offered up for their ſins, and for our ſakes, the great Saviour of the world would rayſe to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (at thy right hand,) the body which he had taken of the Virgin, inſtituting the Sacrament of his body and of his blood: to the intent that That, which was once offered for the ſatisfaction of our ſinnes, ſhould continually be honoured by a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>Baptiſme admitteth us into an ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God, inſtead of ciricum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion:

            <p>Baptiſme, is called Regeneration, that is to ſay, a new birth. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, The Communion of the body and blood of our Lord, to nouriſh us to life eternal. Of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, water is the ſign, The blood of Chriſt the thing ſignified: The water which waſheth the ſtaines of the body; The blood which clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſins of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>In the holy Supper, the bread and the wine are the ſignes, The Body and the blood of Chriſt, the things ſignified, and ſignified moſt conveniently and properly, by theſe ſignes of bread and wine: for as much as the nouriſhment of our ſouls which is in Chriſt, could not be better expreſſ'd than by that of our Body, which converteth into their ſuſtance that which they eate and drink.</p>
            <p>So in the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, the bread which is bleſt, and which is broken and given to eate, and the cup which is bleſſed and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170524:76"/>mee to drink, repreſents to me, The body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt given and ſhed for me on the Croſſe, to me are the ſacred Symboles and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured earneſts, that I am received into the communication of his body, and of his blood, which I ſpiritually enjoy by Faith, in the Participation of the ſupper. When I ſee the bread broken in the celebration of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I meditate with my ſelf of his body, which hath ſuffered death on the Croſſe for the remiſſion of my ſinnes.</p>
            <p>When I behold the wine poured into the cup, I call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance his blood ſhed for to acquire (for me) life eternal.</p>
            <p>By the receiving the bread and the wine, I enter by faith into a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, into the ſociety of the body and blood of the Son of God: I draw life, I draw abſolution, and am cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with his innocence and with his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>By the viſſible receiving (which I performe) of the bread and of the wine, I am aſſured, that I am ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually united to Chriſt, and made a

            <p>When I receive the bread and the wine, I receive not only the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are the figures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſigns of his body and of his blood, but I receive by faith and in ſpirit the things themſelves which are ſignified, and repreſented. Not that the bread and the wine of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt communicate to me his body and blood: but thy goodneſſe, my God, Thy truth, Thy majeſty, Thy vertue and the efficacy of thy holy Spirit, communicate and reach forth this body and blood to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and my ſoul to be ſpiritually eaten and drank by faith: The bread

            <p>His true body, with it's proper eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials, with it's inſeparable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, with it's quantity and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is aſcended to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſet at the right hand of God, where 'tis requiſite that the heavens contain him even until the reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things.</p>
            <p>Thus Lord, I ſeek the body of Chriſt in heaven,<note place="margin">Acts 3.21.</note> by faith I celebrate in the holy Supper the memory of his Death and of his Paſſion: I declare it, I eſteem it, and magnifie it even untill he come, and I receive it not with a carnal mouth and corporal throat, but after a Divine manner, Sacramentally, under a ſignifficant myſtery, with the mouth of my heart, and ſpiritually by faith.</p>

            <p>Alſo Lord, 'tis by faith, that in the celebration of thy holy Supper His body and his blood are preſent and ſubſiſtent in my heart, in my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in my ſoul.</p>
            <p>'Tis by faith, that I embrace his body, and ſuck his blood which diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth from his wounds: And by means of this Sacramental eating and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the body of the Saviour of the world, and this ſpiritual drinking of his blood, I am made bone of his bone, fleſh of his fleſh, I am incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170524:78"/>in him.

            <p>By this holy Sacrament, I am alſo admoniſhed of my duty toward my Neighbour, in regard as we are ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed with the ſame blood, made members of the ſame body, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants of one and the ſame Head: and conſequently, one among our ſelves and by the Commandment of God, and natural duty.</p>
            <p>We all draw life from one and the ſame death; nouriſhment from one and the ſame food, and the ſelf ſame cup.</p>
            <p>Up then my ſoul, 'tis here where thou oughts to Anchor and fix thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, ſtay thy courſe, and caſt thy eyes upon the love of thy God.

            <p>It's the entyre Summe and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign abridgment of his benefits, it's the certaine token of his infinite love, the true treaſure of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Children of God are marked with a different Character, from the reſt of the Citizens of the Earth. God hath aſſigned them for portion here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Poverty, Ignominy, the loſſe of kindred, maladies, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable kinds of deaths; but happy are theſe afflictions tending to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: bleſſed theſe chaſtiſements, which are to correct, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</p>
            <p>Praiſed be God who (by theſe ſtroakes) prevents the celerity of our gangrenes, who hath recourſe to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to preſerve our lives, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the lance to the inflammations of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170524:85"/>our ulcers, untill the venome ceaſes to prevail.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom he corrects not, are ſuch whom he diſdaines to amend, thoſe are the children of the World, who have their Paradiſe on earth, not in heaven.</p>
            <p>Their wealth often exceeds their wiſhes, their honour ſurmounts their deſires: but the ſeaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light fades in an inſtant, and that of their calamity is eternal.</p>
            <p>The Fatherly hand afflicteth not them daily, they are only buffetted by the enemy of men, which cometh too late, and in recompence he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth them for ever.</p>
            <p>Let us (then) call to mind that it's fore-told in the Goſpel, that we are deſtined to ſuffer griefs, to ſupport out-rages, and be cut off from the world: and that we are commanded to comfort our ſelves in theſe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to skip for joy in the midſt of our torments, for aſmuch as our reward is great in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>If we ſuffer our ſelves to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by heavineſſe beyond meaſure,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170524:86"/>'tis to be ſuſpected that afflictions will overcome us, &amp; give us over to deſpair, as unworthy the conſolations, which are preſented to us by the hand of God, and of the certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which he hath left us by writing in his Word.</p>
            <p>Let us raiſe up our ſoules (then) above all the things of this World.</p>
            <p>Direct our cogitations to remember the ſtate of our lives, and on the remedies which God hath beſtowed on us to ſolace our ſorrowes and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: of a truth, our proſperity, &amp; the ſweetneſſe of content ordinarily paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in a little ſpace, and giveth place to afflictions, who march on with a hideous and frightful viſage.</p>
            <p>Our life is nothing but a motion, if one day be pleaſant, another renders it ſelf unſupportable: and that we enjoy of content, never continues conſtant.</p>
            <p>But ſince this is the condition, in which it pleaſeth God we ſhould live, we muſt not adde our bloody hands to tear our wounds, and become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in reſpect of what remaines, for the regreat of what we have loſt.</p>
            <p>It's folly to take on ones ſelf the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170524:86"/>puniſhment of his infelicity, to ſtay upon the part offended, and to look upon the worſt ſide of our lives.</p>
            <p>Let's not (then) more imbitter our evils by our impatience, neither (hereafter) render our greene wounds and emotions, mortal ſtroakes, and incurable ulcers.</p>
            <p>Let's caſt behind us that puſilanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ever puts us to flight, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to caſt forth cries equal to the meaſure that the Ocean is irritated and raiſed up againſt us, and hinders us from ſuſtaining the ſtorm without being appall'd.</p>
            <p>Let's fortifie our hearts, let's fill them with aſſurance, to the intent that contemplating with a confident brow the miſeries of the world, not to apprehend their approach, to ſuſtain them with a couragious aſpect, and encounter them with valour.</p>
            <p>Let's approach afflictions to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and (by the way) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve our ſelves to conſtancy. The Souldier is unworthy of that name, who trembles ſo ſoon as he beholds an enemy, and perſwades himſelf
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170524:87"/>that already their Sword is at his throat: and he is marveilous feeble, who is afraid at the only appearance of afflictions. Their view cannot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us, and their endeavours (if we pleaſe) may be rendered ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeleſſe.</p>
            <p>Why (then) make we any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to enter into the liſts againſt them; ſince their wounds ought to harden us, conſtantly to ſuffer their aſſaults? Thoſe who are nouriſht in the ſhade, dread the ardure of the Sun, and not thoſe that are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it.</p>
            <p>Children are apprehenſive, and fear to behold their blood, and not old Souldiers, who have of't ſeen it, as it were continually to diſtill, and flow from their wounds.</p>
            <p>Few new afflictions can preſent themſelves, we already have beheld and ſuſtained the moſt of them: if they be great and confiderable, the more danger and peril, the more glory.</p>
            <p>What delight to rend off the ſcales which would forme themſelves againſt the brightneſſe of our eyes?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170524:87"/>what ſatisfaction to prevent thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which would trouble our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</p>
            <p>Up then, let us learn to accuſtome our ſelves to all diverſity and inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life, and to receive every thing of the ſaving hand of God.</p>
            <p>And as the Superiour part of the aire, which is neareſt to the heavens, is never darkned with clouds, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated with thunders: ſo our ſoules, (ever elevated above theſe paſſions,) ſhould never be ſhamefully overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under griefs and ſadneſſe, but ſo much as is neceſſary to bring her to repentance.</p>
            <p>Let us not precipitate our ſelves deſperately as mad men, after our affections: enduring (with all our heart) the adverſity of the world, ever calling to mind, that as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine benedictions, which we ſhall one day enjoy, are ſetled in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and happy rank, ſo (alſo) theſe mortal things are toſſed by an infinite number of bluſtres, and totter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſometimes to one ſide, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to another.</p>
            <p>It is familiar in the croud and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170524:88"/>throng of a battel, to take ones for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; upon the Ocean, to be beaten with ſtormes, upon the earth with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe afflictions.</p>
            <p>The Pilate, for having been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſo many tempeſts, cannot longer dread Ship-wrack.</p>
            <p>The Souldier for the frequency and aſſiduity of peril contemns danger: The infinite number of afflictions ſhould inſtruct us not to eſteem them as conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Our life is no other than a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al war-fare: if ſometimes we are free from heavineſſe, it's nothing but a ſhort truce with the world; or rather a ſuſpenſion of armes, and no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, no entire peace.</p>
            <p>If the Sunne ſhines bright, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtorm (in an inſtant) chaſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſerenity of the ayre, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all with darkneſſe: if we behold a glimpſe of light, we are again plunged preſently into a more cloſe priſon.</p>
            <p>War interrupts peace, ſickneſſe, health, death, the ſweetneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Pleaſure and ſorrow are of near aſſinity, and ever entertain
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170524:88"/>each other. Such is the condition of men, againſt which plaints are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: Such it was to thoſe in ages paſt, and ſo ſhall it be to them in time to come.</p>
            <p>The remedy is, that we ſerve our ſelves of theſe changes as Muſitians of Tones, flat, ſharp and diverſe. It's neceſſary that we learn to conduct our veſſel; not onely in calme, ſtill waters, but alſo in the high going and rough billowes.</p>
            <p>Contrary winds do not hinder that we aid our ſelves by following the North, if ſo be we hoyſe and trimme our ſailes as we ought.</p>
            <p>The bitterneſſe of griefs are ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by remedies, the nettles do not ſting, when we preſſe them very hard, nor afflictions when we tread on their throat.</p>
            <p>If they made choice of perſons, if in paſſing by ſome, they ſpar'd them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, their inequality would be more inſupportable: but the bullet is blind, it pierces as ſoon the Captain as the Souldier: The feavour is deaf, it retires not ſooner for the plaints of the greateſt, than the meaneſt: The
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170524:89"/>heat of the Sunne ſcorches without diſtinction all thoſe who are in the Plain: The cold as eaſily penetrates the Velvets as the Shagges; and death overturnes every one without excepting any, to the intent that the equality of each ones neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, ſhould ſerve for a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <p>But if it appeares to us, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſome who are ever at their eaſe, who live and flouriſh in great plenty of all things, without encountering any affliction: aſſuredly we abuſe our ſelves; it's the luſtre of their habits, which daſles us, their Port and Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which deceives us: we ſee not with what a multitude of agitations their ſoules are tormented, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, and what deſires vex their ſpirits, putting them into inquietude, and interrupting their repoſe: we ſee not their Catarrs, their iſſues, and the cryes they ſend forth in the dolour of their ſtone and gout: the condition of their ſpirit, and diſpoſition of their Bodies is unknown to us.</p>
            <p>They go not forth of their houſes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170524:89"/>but in health, they ſhew not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in publick, but with a cheareful countenance, whereas often their hearts are heavy, and that is it which deceives us; and then, what know we what afflictions they have had heretofore, what diſtempers, then when we were in health: what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe at ſuch time, when we were in delight? what underſtand we what miſchiefs hang over their heads, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to overcome and deſtroy them? An Ague is ready, a peſtilent ayre, a weakneſſe, a fall, the treachery of an enemy: And if we be not ſatisfied with ſo many Conſiderations, let's caſt down our ſight, and beholding ſo many poor people afflicted of all ſorts, ſeeing the beggar often in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, for default of finding a morſel of brown bread.</p>
            <p>Behold them tormented with a feavour, impaired, languiſhing; laid overturned on the pavement: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the greateſt conſolation which they receive from our charity, they are dragged to a hideous place fil'd with wretches: there they underſtand nothing but cries, but plaints, but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170524:90"/>groanes, but gaſpings after death: oft-times the dead remaining long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, before they be enterred: and thus in theſe continued miſeries, they finiſh their lives.</p>
            <p>Behold on the other ſide, a poor father ſick, ſtretch't out upon the ſtraw, to whom bread is wanting when his labour failes him, having five or ſix ſmall children lying about him, crying for hunger.</p>
            <p>Behold one Bed-ridden of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie theſe foure yeares, continually pierc't through with heavineſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly gaſping after death: if we be ſo miſchievous to receive any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the harmes of another, agreeable to our ſorrowes: 'Tis moſt facile for us (by this communion of miſeries) to aſſwage our own, and to mitigate our affliction; by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other afflicted ones, which are ſo innumerable.</p>
            <p>But let's return to our ſelves, what advantage have we by ſo many plaints? do our afflictions retire for our cryes?<note place="margin">☞</note> no, they never ſwerve out of their way.</p>

            <p>If by lamentations we think to chaſe away our evils; If by teares we hope to lift up the Tombs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and enlighten again the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht lives of our friends: I ſhould be of opinion to enforce our ſelves to diſtill out all we have of oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
            <p>But if our lamentations bring them no advantage, if that our regreates are not ſo much as underſtood by them, if the marble that preſſeth them, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not our groanes, to what end are ſo many unprofitable ſighths, ſo many rages, ſo many faintings to no effect?</p>
            <p>If it be in regard of them, 'tis fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if for our own, do we love our eaſe ſo much, then as to cruciate our ſelves for the loſſe of one content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of one ſupport, or a little wealth?</p>

            <p>Who is more praiſe-worthy, or he who being ſurpriz'd and overtaken by an affliction, doth by his impatience aggrevate and imbitter his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and gives himſelf to deſpair? or rather he, who yieldeth not to it's aſſaults, and thereby abates and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the force of adverſity by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible heart, and couragiouſly bears away the victory?</p>
            <p>The good diſpoſition of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhould not change as that of our bodies, according to Climates and Moons.</p>
            <p>This World, which beholds our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may afflict them, but not our ſoules, which ſhould (continually) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the hand of God; what though our bodies are ſometimes lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,

            <p>And why bemoan we our ſelves for ſo many diſeaſes? underſtand we not that our bodies are no other than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of corruption, and that many of them are hereditary, and left us as a ſad patrimony? If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of how many diverſe parts our bodies are compoſ'd and fram'd, to how many ſeveral accidents each is ſubject, and that the leaſt change which cauſeth diſcord, is ſufficient to caſt us into a feavour; nought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, but to admire, how we are ſometimes ſo long without pain.

               <hi>who made Joſhua to Triumph over thirtie one Kings, who ſtayed (in favour of his Battailes) the Sun in the midst of his courſe, and made him continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable for a long ſpace of time, whil'ſt that he overturned his enemies (by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions) on the duſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis he who confirmed <hi>Iſrael</hi> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> before that great Thunderbolt of war, cauſing that the fury of a ſtone, parting from the hand of a Shepheard, ſhould plant it ſelf in the midſt of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>'Tis the ſame who fill'd <hi>Heſter</hi> with courage againſt <hi>Haman,</hi> who cauſed that <hi>Baruch,</hi> that <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> that <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſo many Prophets have combated Kingdomes, have cloſed the throats of Lyons, have repell'd the force of fire, have eſcap't the devouring ſword,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170524:97"/>have ſhewed themſelves mighty in Battle, and turned their enemies to flight.</p>
            <p>But theſe are favours which flow from his hand when it pleaſeth him, and then only when he knows it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for his glory.</p>
            <p>In the interim we are obliged to reſt ſatisfi'd with our condition, in the which it pleaſeth him we ſhould live,<note place="margin">☜</note> and receive thoſe corrections which he giveth us, to the intent to amend us: who oppoſes himſelf againſt God, to repine &amp; bemoan himſelf, ſhall incurre the danger (inſtead of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary adverſity,) to ſuffer eternal torments.</p>
            <p>The afflictions which overtake us, are ordained by ſolemn Decrees; whereto we ought to acquieſſe and ſubmit; by Ordinances, againſt which it's not permitted we open our mouthes.</p>
            <p>The Murmur againſt Decrees ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is puniſh't as the entyre voyce, the Will, as the Effect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe are afflictions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our health. Ruines, to cauſe us turne to our wealth, Poverty, to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170524:98"/>make us regard our riches.</p>
            <p>The clattering of his Thunder falls to awaken us, his corrections to put us upon repentance, Theſe chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to force from our hearts ſigths and repentance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the effects of the love of the Creatour, teſtimonies, that he ever has an eye over his work-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that he will make them underſtand their errors.</p>
            <p>The Soveraigne Law of a King, is the ſafety of his People, of God the ſafety of his own, to make them ever tend to that poynt, he applyeth all manner of remedyes: obſerving them too intent on the world, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the loſſe of their ſubſtance, the loſſe of their kindred, and by theſe torments he awakneth their zeale, which ſlumber'd in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time: He diſturbeth their eaſe, to preſerve their ardure from ruſting, He imployeth the Fanne to clenſe his Graine, Vineger to efface the aines.</p>
            <p>He is the Phyſitian, who laboureth for health, not for pleaſure, who would heal the diſtemper, not ſooth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170524:98"/>and flatter it, who ordaineth rather Ruburb than Suger, who uſeth ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſharpe medicines, but very healthful: we muſt not expect from him Flowers, Straw-berries and Cream: but bitter rootes, nautious Pills, and Potions black and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
            <p>He extracts out of our ſufferings, our proſperity, and that which ſeemes to us, to tend to our deſtruction, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to what makes for our ſafety: He conſerves us by ſtrict dyets, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame thirſt, and ſevers our Rotten members which cannot be continued without the deſolution of the whole Body.</p>
            <p>But then when our well-fare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that ſo it muſt be, it's better to periſh in part, then entyrely, to loſe one, than both our eyes: of't-times a member ſpar'd, coſts the life.</p>
            <p>If we be alwayes heated with Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we ever live at our eaſe, what a multitude of deſigns would take up our thoughts and interpoſe that we lift not up our ſoules to that which is on high? with how little difficultie will we permit our ſelves to ſlip into vices,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170524:99"/>and to be partakers of all the vanities of the word? That little interval we have enjoyed, gives us full aſſurance, the example of very many removes all doubt.</p>
            <p>We are ſlothful to our ſafety, we muſt be preſt to it, we are ſlack, and advance not but by conſtraint.</p>
            <p>The Eagle hovers round about her young, to teach them to rayſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the earth, he lets ſome dayes paſſe without feeding them, to the intent that hunger may compell them to ſeek out their food: and for the utmoſt remedy: He beats them, he corrects their ſloth with ſtrokes both with his beak and wings.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the great God delivers his Ordinances into our hands, to obſerve them, He commands us to obey them, he ſummons, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us: and in concluſion when bare words makes no impreſſion in our hardned hearts, He puts us forward, and conſtraines us through ſundry afflictions. He deals by us, as a Father who haſtily ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Knife out of the hand of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170524:99"/>childe, fearing he ſhould hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and forbeares not for his crying: As the Father who retyres his ſonne from the brinck of the River, and in with-drawing him, corrects him, to the end he ſhould not return again; He chaſtiſeth us, to the intent we ſhould reſent our offences: he leads us off, beating us, and ever addes ſome ſurcharge to our afflictions, thereby to humble us.</p>
            <p>During our proſperity we pride our ſelves, beholding every thing with a ſcorneful eye, we value none but our ſelves, and think not of ought but our content and felicity.</p>
            <p>And as bodies that are fatted, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh under their proper weight, and ſtoop beneath the burthen and charge of themſelves: in like manner, our overmuch and continual repoſe drowns us in pleaſures, and (leſſons in delights) the firſt glances men obſerve to blaze of our zeal and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to purſue the path of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
            <p>The skilful Phyſician ſometimes breaths a veine, not for preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but to prevent and remove
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170524:100"/>the cauſe of that malady he judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: In like manner, God afflicts us to turn us from vices, which we are ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
            <p>And ſo he prunes off many branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a plant, to the intent it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fruitful: we undergo afflictions, to the intent we may fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the more; and that we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our zeal.</p>
            <p>That we may preſerve our ſelves dextrous and ſtrong, we accuſtome our ſelves to Juſts &amp; Turneys, we counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit war in a full &amp; abſolute peace: and to preſerve our ſoules ever amiable, alwayes healthy, do we refuſe adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, afflictions, and tryals? we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not of our felicity, but by the ſame meaſure that we recent evil,<note place="margin">☞</note> we joy not in heaven, but ſo far as earth torments us, we embrace not God, but in the ſame degree that men afflict us.</p>
            <p>Men diſtinguiſh the children of God by their ſcars, their ſongs are ſighths: their garments ſable, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gloomy; their Edifices Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the Grave.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:170524:100"/>
            <p> Men ſend the ſtout Souldier to the aſſault, they plant him in the midſt of the breach, they place him in the mouth of the Cannon; the Loyal in battel, againſt difficulties, loſſes and vexations.</p>
            <p>The Courage of the Souldier, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and relents during the truce, his generoſity abates, if he be long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Field of battel: In like-ſort, the zeal of Gods Children languiſheth, and conſumeth it ſelf in time of proſperity.</p>
            <p>He there ſignalizeth himſelf by the ſcars in his front, and by the wounds received for default of his Armes: This here, by afflictions proceeding from the hand of the Omnipotent God.</p>
            <p>All his adverſities are advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, theſe rubarbs are healthful nouriſhments, and bitterneſſes tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pleaſantneſſe; we may not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Caterpiller, converting flowers into poyſon: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which hardens it ſelf againſt the Hammer.</p>
            <p>The ſonnes of earth, who ſinke in deſpaire: The valiant brow ſearches
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170524:101"/>the glory of Lawrels and Palms, for te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of their courage: the true believers ſuffer the honour of croſſes, of griefs and tryals, for ſignes of their faith.</p>
            <p>Let's then quit the Field to theſe Panick, theſe feeble amaſements, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing them under our weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: enduring them with a cheareful aſpect; (ſince 'tis the pleaſure of God) that afflictions (as pointed arrowes) ſhould be fixt in our bodies.</p>
            <p>Suffering with conſtancy, if his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy hand preſſeth us on, abates us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members us, and hence forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather apt to penance than plaints. Being of good courage, he is ever a ſpectatour of his own, who ſtrugle and conteſt againſt calamity: He is ever at hand to yield them cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by their ſides to aid and aſſiſt them: He was by <hi>Job ſtretcht out on the Dunghill:</hi> He accompanied <hi>the three Children in the Furnace;</hi> He deſcended with <hi>Daniel into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt crannies of the Den of Lyons;</hi> He was near <hi>Elias in the Deſart, with Saint Peter in the Priſons, with ſuch a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170524:101"/>multitude of Martyrs in the midſt of the flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This labour is an exerciſe of true Courage, in the ſweat whereof men finde felicity: The end, the aime, whereunto we are call'd, is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and admirable, that we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidg'd to embrace all enterpriſes, which may conduct us thither: Then let theſe Ignominies, theſe faded, withered things, theſe dolours be our Lawrels, our Palmes, our Crowns: let them be the marks of our vertue, engraven on our bodies.</p>
            <p>Let us chearefully receive theſe Preſents from the hand of God, let's reliſh theſe wholſome medicines, let's embrace (if it be the pleaſure of God) wounds, Martyrdome and Death.</p>
            <p>What then? If for his honour and glory, if the more to publiſh the Name and Merit of the Saviour of the World; He delivers us into the hands of theſe Barbarians, who oppoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick afflictions, and the horrour of death, to check the progreſſe of the Name of Chriſt: who ſeek not their glory, but by the meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170524:102"/>of their cruelty againſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Chriſtians: if he deliver us into the power of theſe Butchers, who imagine the heavenly Field is husbanded as ours, by the labour and aſſiſtance of the Iron: who perſecute us by publick puniſhments, by the aſtoniſhment of flames, by the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Gibbets, and of Pillaries: ſurfeting of blood and carcaſſes, and by the dread of Butchers prepared to death and deſtruction?</p>
            <p>What? Shall we not conſerve this precious earneſt, this holy gage, this divine faith planted in our hearts by the powerful operation of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Spirit? Shall we not inviolab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve this ſacred oath of fidelity given to Jeſus Chriſt at our birth?</p>
            <p>What? Shall we not freely laviſh out our blood on ſo glorious an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion?</p>
            <p>What? (That we renounce not our faith, our ſalvation) ſhall we not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance boldly to death, whereby we ſhall paſſe to immortality? let not theſe Barbarians (then) imagine by the fear of their torments, to wreſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170524:102"/>from us any expreſſions looſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Faith is the greateſt gift, which men have received from the hand of God.</p>
            <p>Faith is of ſuch vaſt importance, that it muſt out-ballance every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſideration; when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes our faith, we muſt ſuffer none to be more Eminent, more Gallant, more Generous than the Chriſtian; nothing more ſcorning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the Sword, more deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the flames, more contemning death: 'tis neceſſary that we bedew and beſprinkle her with our blood, and reſtifie it with our death; 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that it augment our zeal in the Priſons, that we profeſſe and affirme it before Magiſtrates, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it in Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>Rendering our ſelves like green Trees, who bowe themſelves on one ſide, when men would force them to yield to the other: ſtiffning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves proportionably, as men would bend them: Imitating the Diamond, which obſtinately reſiſts both the iron and the fire: as the gold who ſpreads
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170524:103"/>well, but waſts not; which loſeth his droſſe, but not his weight; his ſcurſe, but not his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: like the quick-ſilver, the which the more men preſſe it to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it together, the more he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, the more he is excited to obtain his liberty, and free, goes vaniſhing and ſpreading into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of particles.</p>
            <p>Do we make any difficulty to enter upon tryal of the conſtancy of a true Chriſtian? Feare we the ran-counter of ſo rare, ſo precious a Prize, for which ſo many of our Fathers have improved, and fatned the earth with their bodyes, and run ſo cheerefully to Martyrdome, to joyne themſelves eternally to God? Let's manieſt that we are true ſhoots of thoſe Ancient ſtocks which have produc't ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and pleaſant fruit: Let's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we are ſucceſſors of the ſplendor of their faith.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this fayre occaſion that they have eſteem'd it ſo honourable to ſuffer: 'Tis by this ſtaire and aſſent that they are mounted into heaven, by this Road that they are paſt into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal beatitude.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170524:103"/>
            <p> Let's (then) hereafter be alwayes raviſh't, ever taken with a Divine fervour: not having other aime nor object than what concernes the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the great God, and the ſalvation of our ſouls: for the reſt of the world have not other eſteeme than ſo farre forth as it ſhall ſerve to advance and attaine it.</p>
            <p>It's not onely permitted to us to beleeve in Chriſt, but alſo to ſuffer for him: Conſider with our ſelves that we have to ſtruggle againſt fleſh and blood, againſt Principalities and Powers, and the Signeories of the world.</p>
            <p>If God will not nouriſh us in the ſhadow, if he calls us to the tryal, let's glory in tribulations, ſupporting our ſelves with conſtancy. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that our enemies give us many aſſaults, yet for all that the glory, the crown belongs not to them.</p>
            <p>God afflicts and viſits, God imploies thoſe that he loveth: and thoſe whom he ſeemeth to favour, He reſerveth to Deſolation: Chaſtiſements cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us; and impunity carries away them.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:170524:104"/>
            <p> St. <hi>Paul ſaith that he gave not place by ſubmiſſion, no not for a moment, to the intent that the truth of the Goſpel might be permanent:</hi> He ſaith that he made reckoning of nothing, that his life is not precious to him,<note place="margin">Cal. 2.5.</note> to the end that he may finiſh his courſe in the Grace of God.<note place="margin">Acts 20.22.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> delighted rather to expoſe himſelf to the ſavageneſſe of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, He choſe ſooner to be caſt into their Den, wherein he expected to be (in an inſtant) diſmembred, than to abſtain (for thirtie dayes) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore God with his windowes open, as he did afore time.</p>

            <p>It's moſt certain that there is but one path, to arive at felicity, but one only heavenly Collume, whereon we muſt take place, but one only Arke wherein we muſt be encloſed to avoid the Deluge. All other wayes, how Contiguous, how neare, how like ſoever they be, lead directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jawes of the Divel. All other veſſels, but that of <hi>Noah</hi> ſplit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed by the waves.</p>
            <p>The truth of the Goſpel is publiſh't by the voice of the Apoſtles, proved by Myracles, ſealed by the blood of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and acknowledged by the evil ſpirits: What? ſhall we be ſo very deteſtable as to bely the holy writ, to reject our ſalvation, to diſſavow our Saviour? He deſcended for us, hath ſuffered for us, hath dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us: ſhall we make difficulty to confeſſe him, to ſuffer for him, to dye for him? No, No, let our ſpeeches ever agree with our thoughts, let our thoughts be always the ſame with our words.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170524:105"/>
            <p> Let's not caſt our ſelves (by the ſound of our lips) into the ſnares of Satan, that the fear of torments cauſe us not to renounce heaven, that the dread of death make us not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Jeſus Chriſt and his heritage: that our Timidity occaſion not a ſad ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack in the very harbour: not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our affections with fortune, nor varying our Face like as a Maſſe of wax, nor our habitation as the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring foul for the cold.</p>
            <p>Let not the bands of the vanity of the world ſo eclips our ſight, that we diſcern not our offence, that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes ſtifle and extinguiſh not the bright ſparkles of our ſoules; that our deſires deprive us not of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We have taſted the heavenly gift, let not an Emotion and light diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe us to diſgorge and vomit it, we are pure, let's not fill our ſelves with Ordure: we are clean, let's not defile our ſelves in the myre: Electing rather a glorious and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable grave, than a lothſome, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous life.</p>
            <p>Let's rather inſtantly dye with a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170524:105"/>ſound and entyre ſpirit, let's finiſh now our voyage and life with God, than here (for a ſhort ſpace) with the world, with diſpayre, with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Who would preſerve himſelf by quitting the Helme, ſuffereth ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack: who imagins to recoyle one ſtep, tumbleth into a bottomleſſe deep: who retyres from Paradiſe, precipitateth himſelf into hell.</p>
            <p>God hath not ordained all to be out-rag'd for his holy Name, all are not capable: God hath not marked all the inhabitants of the earth with the badge of his Sonne, few are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like the Maſter.</p>
            <p>There's but one plant taken of the ſtock, of the plant, one bunch, of the bunch, a few grapes.</p>
            <p>Bleſt is he who is capable, happy he who is treated as the Maſter, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py he who is of thoſe grapes.</p>
            <p>The Children of this World, who are not couch't in a divine eſtate make themſelves merry; they are weak-ſighted, altogether imperfect to contemplate on heavenly myſteries; they are ſtrayed too far to recover the right way, they imagine not that the

            <p>'Tis (then) in this Combat againſt afflictions and death, that we muſt conteſt, that we muſt vanquiſh, and that we muſt ſearch for the Crown of Chriſtianity, and Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>Our hearts will be cruſh't, our eyes blemiſht, but our ſouls ſhall be filled with gladneſſe: we ſhall be beaten, we ſhall be torn, but our zeal ſhall augment, and in its augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our contentment ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>Thou Barbarian, thou mayſt raviſh our goods, but the Eternal will not forſake us: thou can'ſt exile us, but all the Earth is the Lords.</p>
            <p>Thou can'ſt threaten our lives, but 'tis thoſe of our bodies, 'tis that of the World, our ſoules are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
            <p>Thou mayeſt ſend us to death, but we conduct our ſelves thither, we there
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170524:106"/>ſhall receive it, we will there ſuffer it patiently: Our ſpirits are heads and maſters of our bodies, they are ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the aſſiſtance of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Spirit, that they are able to ſurmount all ſorts of torments, and death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Infidels, with what do you affright us ſo much? with puniſhment! with what do you menace us ſo highly? to take away our lives? with what do you make us ſo much afraid? of death!</p>
            <p>O pitiful Adverſaries, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn, we deſpiſe the world, we make no account of afflictions, we trample over the fear of death. Ha, wherefore ſhould we fear ſo much to give for ſo admirable and excellent a Subject, ſo Glorious, ſo Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

            <p>Let us ſuffer (if it be the pleaſure of God, to deliver us into the hands of theſe Butchers) if they cauſe our bodies to ſtoop under the weight of Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuffer, if they redouble their rage, if they do not forbear any kind of cruelty, and as Lyons Whelps fil'd
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170524:114"/>with fleſh, they feed their eyes on our dead bodies; and dabble their hands in our bloody effuſions: God will aſſiſt us with his power, and will raiſe us by his Omnipotent Spirit, (when 'tis for the honour of his Name) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the racks and flames.</p>
            <p>The moſt cruel torments ſhall not be conſiderable to us, the greateſt, moſt ponderous puniſhments ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto us, theſe cruelties cannot aſtoniſh us, death it ſelf, ſhall be life.</p>
            <p>Our faith ſhall ſuſtain our bodies, ſeeing them torn, it ſhall the more encourage us to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Our holy zeal ſhall delude the moſt ſowre afflictions, will cauſe us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into flames, without amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhalconſume our ſelves, with ſatisfaction, embracing Martyrdome. We ſhall imitate thoſe Martyrs, who for ſuch a ſubject have endured a thouſand afflictions, have a thouſand times ſpilt their blood, have ſuſtained a thouſand flames.</p>
            <p>Theſe Martyrs, whoſe Names and Renowns, have found the earth too narrow to comprehend them.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170524:114"/>
            <p> Theſe Martyrs who have magnifi'd Chriſtianity by their blood, who have accepted Martyrdome for their Crown.</p>
            <p>Theſe Martyrs, who by a few tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are gone for ever into Supreme felicity.</p>
            <p>Up then Barbarians, what havock and ſlaughter ſoever you make of our bodies, we remain firme and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lv'd to die. Our bodies are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh't, our ſpirits remain Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>You ſhall behold us languiſh full of delight in a divine Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee our blood boyling with devotion, to diſtill and trickle into the flames.</p>
            <p>That our death ſhall be lovely and beautiful, to be for ever famous to Chriſtianity! That our bodies ſhall be bleſſed, to be conſumed for the glory of the Saviour of the World! That our blood ſhall be precious to witneſſe, and trace out the way to heaven! That thoſe flames ſhall be exquiſite, which ſet a luſtre on the truth, in the eyes of a throng and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170524:115"/>croud of poor Ignorants! That our aſhes ſhall be pretious, to celebrate, publiſh, and to ſpread the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men!</p>
            <p>If the earth be glutted with our blood, the example of our Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, will make us re-created by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads: if they conſume us, as the Phenix, we ſhall be renewed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our aſhes.</p>

            <p>Thou runneſt out of knowledge in theſe ſlippery paths, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thy feebleneſſe, without conſidering that at the firſt ſtep, upon the firſt advance thou mayſt ſtumble, that a ſprain may turn thee quite ſhort, and that thou haſt no ſooner weighed anchor, than thou art in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Ship-wrack; thy health hath puft thee up, thy courage hath raiſed

            <p>O Lord, the World to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath poſſeſſed me: her deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have intoxicated me: at this inſtant my ſinnes ſtare in my face, as if I were awaked from a proſound ſlumber.</p>
            <p>I begin to recover my ſpirits, my eyes retort their looks upon my ſelf, to behold my weakneſſe, and my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy tyred and conſum'd with the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which is mixt with my blood, and with the pain which torments it, is conſtrain'd to acknowledge her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to reject her Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Lord, theſe fogs which obſcure heaven to me, begin to fall off, my Soul (ſo long blinded) recovers ſome glimmering.</p>

            <p>Poor Carcaſſe! thy Original is in infection, thy habitation in a ſtation fil'd with tempeſts, with diſeaſes, with torments, with bloody wars: in a place common to the ſavage beaſts, upon an ingrateful earth, out of which thou can'ſt extract nothing, but with the Plow-ſhare and edge of the Iron.</p>
            <p>For thy end, thy fleſh is the prey and triumph of wormes, thy deſigns and thy grandures are buried with thee in the ſame ſhroud. Thy ſorreſts are reduc'd to a biere, thy buildings to a ſtone; and yet thou art ſo blind, ſo bewitch't with the love of the earth, which diſpoyles thee of the knowledg of thy condition, that thou dayly augmenteſt the number of thy vowes, of thy wiſhes, of thy deſires, which preſſe thee hourly forward, until God, with the celerity of his ayd prevents thy fall, ſtretches his hand over thee for to interrupt thee, to make thee behold the vanity of thy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170524:117"/>and cogitations, to make thee feel the earth to totter already under thy feet, that ſhe is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand what thou haſt borrowed of her, and to ſhew thee the fatal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, the horrible depths, and frightful gulfes, within which all thy paſſions would deſtroy thee. Beſtir thee then, vapour of earth, ſhadow of life, ſince the great God deſcends from his Throne to abaſe himſelf even to thee, and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thee.</p>
            <p>Come then, order and command all thy unworthy, ſervile and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh imaginations to retire from thee; diſpoyle thy ſelf of man, ſubmit thy ſpirit unto God, and to thy ſpirit all the affaires of the World: ſmother up in thy breaſt, thy ſtinking breaths, and permit truth only to proceed out of thy mouth.</p>
            <p>O Lord, I am duſt, compoſ'd of the earth, my members fram'd of this imperfection, are apt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
            <p>I am like the flower, which hath its birth and funeral in the ſame day, who in twelve houres ſees it's ſpring
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170524:117"/>and winter, birth and death.</p>
            <p>I am like the Roſe, who in his blooming, regardeth his decline, as the Lillies, who ſhoots up ſuddenly to periſh; as all the flowers of one morn, which the ſame inſtant blooms and fades, which the leaſt wind dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and cauſeth to fall.</p>
            <p>This body increaſeth in it's ſpring time, then cometh its Summer, the winter ſeaſes, and nips it, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no more: the leaſt cold chills it, diſpoyles it, as the Trees of leaves, and of its natural vigour: and oft times in its firſt ſeaſon, it falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num'd by ſome glance of thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; thou moweſt it in thy fury, as the graſſe: one ſtroak, a feavour ſtops his courſe and his life, and ſo many ſundry miſchiefs which conſpire its deſtruction, in the end prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, it vaniſheth, and choaks its memory.</p>
            <p>Lord, I am born of the dregs of the World, I acknowledge it moſt reaſonable that I have a ſenſe of it: out of rottenneſſe, proceeds nought but clay, of corruption, but wormes: The earth hath produc't me, hath
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170524:118"/>nouriſht me to receive its accidents, to participate its wretchedneſſe. I am unlike the Fiſhes, who live in the Sea, without reliſhing of the Salt, and without being diſtur'bd by the winds and tempeſts. I am more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to the humours of the earth, I am ſubject to all its evils; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it abounds and cannot decline their attaints: every day threatens my life, and every houre raiſeth me up ſome affliction; but in the midſt of theſe evils, I muſt not imitate the Children of the world, which think not but of the edge that wounds them,<note place="margin">☞</note> but of the Catarr that ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates them, of the heat that burns them: like to beaſts who convert their rage to ceaze the ſtones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they be wounded, and to wreak their ſpleen with their teeth.</p>
            <p>It's requiſite, Lord, that I raiſe up my Soul toward thy hand, from whence the ſtroak proceeded, toward thy arme who darts the ſtone, toward thee, who reſerveſt (in thy power) the poyſon and the antidote, reſt and labour, death and life.</p>
            <p>'Tis neceſſary that my afflictions
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170524:118"/>admoniſh me to retire my ſelf from theſe innumerable billowes, to arive again at thy favourable harbour. I ought to fix my eyes on thee, who muſt ſerve me as a Star of light, and a Phare during ſo perilous a voyage: toward thee, who already ſeems to comply, to commiſerate my grief, and to offer thy omnipotence for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt find, Lord, my Soul ſhattered by the contagion of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and of its ſenſes; nevertheleſſe, thou remarkeſt ſome traces of thy hand, ſome reliques of thy linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Thou beholdeſt them there ſullied, not defaſt, it's flame and luſtre cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but not extinct: and regarding it in its diſtreſſed condition, thou wilt have compaſſion on thine own image, of the work of thy hands.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt inſpire it with thy holy Spirit, making it glitter again, ſparkle and lighten my obſcurity, for the time I have to live.</p>
            <p>Give him then Lord, ſo much zeal, ſo much fervour to ſeek thee, that as hitherto ſhe hath appear'd cold
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170524:119"/>and lazy: ſhe hath reſembled the earth, who depriv'd of the light of the Sun, remains diſconſolate and ſterill, cover'd over with a profound, troubled ſilence.</p>
            <p>But good God, if thou wilt be pleaſed to diſperſs ſome rayes of thy Spirit to enlighten it, incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all her tranſgreſſions (in the midſt whereof ſhe is buried) will diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as clouds chaſed by the wind: This Ice, frozen about his heart, ſhall diſſolve it ſelf, and ſhall ſlide and trickle on the ground; and ſo he perceiving himſelf diſcharg'd of all his miſeries which oppreſt him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled from ſo many Paſſions that bedim'd him, and animated by the power of thy Spirit, ſhe ſhall preſent her ſelf before thee, contemplating with delight, on that great day, the laſt of this life, full of contentment and ſatisfaction for the Elect, full of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, of dolors and horrible ſighings for the wicked.</p>
            <p>But Lord, can I rationally implore thy favour, and thy aſſiſtance, ſeeing that all my actions merit death? can I well require of thee an abſolution
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170524:119"/>from my offences, which already ſeem fitted and prepared for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction? And this careaſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſtuft with vices, cover'd over with ulcers and ſores, dares it yet boldly humble it ſelf before thy holy Majeſty, whom it hath ſo many waies provoked, to demand pardon, to ſupplicate thee not to permit, that the burning furnace, and the horrible Gulf ſwallow it up? Yes, good God, yes, and with aſſurance: For what though my ſins retyre me far from heaven, never the leſſe, the blood of thy Son ſhed for my clenſing, will give me entrance there, his wounds heal mine, rendering thee prompt to pardon me, hindering thee to deſtroy thine own work-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>His deſcent from heaven was made in my favour, He hath quitted his glory to haſt to my reſcue, by the merit of his death, He hat retyred me from hell, and given me the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over my tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>O Lord, ſince that I am redeemed with ſo precious a ranſome, with ſo high a prize, ſince his innocent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170524:120"/>blood poured on the earth, recoyles upon me, and flowes on every ſide of my body to clenſe it, I will take the boldneſſe to preſent my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thee, and (with aſſurance) to expect that bleſſed day, wherein it will pleaſe thee to retyre my ſpirit, and reduce this body to duſt.</p>
            <p>I will contemplate it with ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and delight, that this world doth not properly belong to us, that thou haſt given us but the uſe of it for a time, for a time which thou cutteſt, which thou ſhortneſt, at all times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment, according to thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And not being leſſe prudent than the ſavage creatures, who know their dens, and love them; and the foules, who deſire their neſts, and they pleaſe themſelves there: I will lift up my ſoul, and direct my eyes toward my true and natural Country, wherein I ought to truſt, toward that heaven, wherein pleaſures are heap't upon delights, wherein (at all ſeaſons) the beauty of the amiable ſpring, flouriſheth, in ſuch delightful cogitations, I ſhall find eaſe to my mallady, the refreſhment proper to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170524:120"/>extinguiſh and ſweeten my ſcortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In theſe pleaſant fountaines I ſhall draw out waters and liquors to allay and temper my feavour, and my heat: and plunging my ſelf into theſe holy ſtreames I ſhall deſpiſe all other remedyes, as being but an aggravation and fomentation of my paine; and although, that where-ever I ſtay my ſelf, my body pains me.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe I ſhall receive more of eaſe in the contemplation of my miſery and of thy Grandure; of the quantity of my offences, and the multitude of thy graces, which they have not, which give not themſelves but to be inquiſitive after divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes, which they eſteem healthful; and find a way and a means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to ſleep by the harmony of reſounding voyces.</p>
            <p>I ſeek not my recovery in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of rootes and herbs, but in the might of thy hand, who hath made the plant to ſpring, and hath given it it's encreaſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſeek my reſt in diverting my ſelf from the remembrance of my
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170524:121"/>mallady, but in reducing to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the wretchedneſſe of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in repreſenting to my ſelf that fancying a thouſand conceptions in my brain.</p>
            <p>I was neare ſwallowed in the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and over-flowings of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, that I have a long time borne the wound in my heart without ſenſe, or without complaint, that I well nigh imitate the fiſh who ſwallow (at the ſame time) the bait and death: That this world never affords me a cheerful look, dains not to ſmile on me; that afflictions have ever clouded my countenance, that my pleaſures are fill'd with torments, my hopes with diſpayres, that the courſe of my afflictions have been equal to thoſe of my dayes.</p>
            <p>Briefly, that I have been a ſubject to all accidents that hang over the head of man, that I am the Butte and white, againſt which all the croſſes and miſ-fortunes of the world, let fly and diſcharge their ſhot, and their arrowes.</p>
            <p>And ſo, Lord, I conſtrain and force not my ſelf to expect my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170524:121"/>in the vertue of herbs. I ſooth and flatter not my mallady, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not my pain in ſtupifying and benuming my ſpirit, or otherwiſe diverting it: I ſeek not my recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in flight, but contrarily, I feel the inequality of my pulce, and the difficulty of my reſpiration: I will conſider how my mallady is fixt, that it is rooted, that it holdeth off my body, and that I beare in my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack the ſpring and receptacle of heat and cold which conſumeth me: and that all the parts of this body ceaſe their operations and ſunctions, through the grief that afflicts them, and not longer able to ſupport it, fail, and yield to death.</p>
            <p>Behold me then, gracious God, as the Bird in croſſing the otian, and not finding where to pirch her ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe hath long laboured with her wings, in the end drops down wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not able to ſtruggle longer, into the ſea and death.</p>
            <p>I have walked among the paths of this world, the Thornes have pricked me, the Brambles have offended me, the ſtones have made me to ſtumble,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170524:122"/>the ſtrokes have bruiſed me, they have batter'd me, the feavours have weakned me, I have ſearch't for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and emplaſters, I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſplinters to ſuſtain my bones, I have ſwallowed bitter juces to drive away my diſtempers, I have ſuſtained and propped this poore cottage on all ſides: but (in concluſion) 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that it ravel, that it crack, that it ſink under it's proper weight: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave Lord, that it ſlacks, that it diſſolves, that it growes looſe: I behold on the other ſide that my ſoul the which ſhe depreſſeth, diſtaſts and cleers himſelf of him by degrees, as not longer able to contain it.</p>
            <p>But alas, It is very requiſite, this poore carcaſſe cannot ever draw his yeares under ſo heavy a bondage, it cannot laſt ever, 'tis neceſſary that in the end ſhe render her ſelf to this deafe and inexorable death, who yields not to any prayres, who comes to ſurprize him without noyſe, and demands his debt without agreeing to delay.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, I muſt (after having ſo long courſe over the ſea, ſlaves to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170524:122"/>ſtormes and tempeſts,) enter the haven, which I have toucht already, that I am already entering into; It's expedient that I retyre out of the croud and throng of the world, to a more pleaſant converſation, and that I ſuſtaine this aſſault and attempt without paleneſſe, without amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without a dejected ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>How! I'ſt not more expedient, I fall once for all, than alwayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tottering? wherefore decline I the terminating of this life, which to me is a paſſage to a thouſand better lives? why ſhould not death be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince ſhe comes to unlooſen the bonds which fetter me ſo cloſſe to anguiſh and miſery? why make I difficulty to embrace death, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heaven, and everlaſting delights and pleaſures, and to arive at the haven where the feare of death ſhall neare approach? Shall I doubt, Lord, that 'tisnot ſeaſonable to dye (ſince 'tis but to live better) till the wayes to live fail; ſhall I preſerve my life to my torment? no, good God, no, I will march confidently unto death,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170524:123"/>I will commit my ſelf to thee, who hold'ſt (in thy hands) the number of my yeares, the bounds and markes of my life.</p>
            <p>I will caſt my ſelf into thy embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the intent thou ſhalt diſpoſe of thy Image and thy clay, according to thy good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I will conſtantly ſuffer the law of my condition, and the decree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't by thy mouth.</p>
            <p>Moreover good Lord, what can I farther expect of my ſo frail life, ſo feeble, ſo ſubject to loſe it ſelf? what can I hope farther of the continuance of this body, which hath endured ſo many miſeries, that hath ſuffered ſo many evils, that hath been ſo of't menac't, and that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light occaſions hath ſo varyed it's condition? can it be but this ſmoak muſt ſometime vaniſh, and that this duſt ſhould be carryed a way with the wind? obſerve I not that the ſtrongeſt, the moſt ſturdy, and moſt healthful are but light ſhadowes, who muſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly encreaſe the number of the dead? That theſe great thunder-bolts of war find themſelves not armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170524:123"/>death? That theſe beautiful treſſes, theſe white breaſts, the line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments of theſe graces are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, and that fame it ſelf who tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over time and death, in the end, tumbles into it's obſcure abode? perceive I not how eaſily old age ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes us, and crumbles our carcaſſes under the weight of his yeares? how highly our dayes glide away.</p>
            <p>That the preſent makes way to the future, that importunes it, that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, that treads on it's heels; that our yeares are conſum'd by months, the months paſſe away by dayes, the dayes glide by houres, and the houres by moments, and that encreaſing to be, we advance our ſelves to decreaſe, and be no more?</p>
            <p>Perceive I not Lord, that in this world all things incline to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, poſting to their period? marching and running into death? and notwithſtanding that there are ſome works of thy hand very durable, yet nevertheleſſe there is nothing that is permanent.</p>
            <p>Witneſſe thoſe great and proud Cities, who find themſelves ſudenly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170524:124"/>devoured and ſuddenly ſwallowed by earth-quakes. Thoſe nations grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent by their long rule &amp; authority, who behold themſelves in an inſtant, mowed down by millions, by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore prepare my ſelf good God, cheerfully to obey thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, I ſhall contemplate on my infirmity which by degrees cuts off the uſe of this life.</p>
            <p>I obſerve that my fall is already far advanc't, that death mixes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds it's ſelf through out my life.</p>
            <p>I ſhall joyfully and cheerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and (with an unaſtoniſh't countenance) that which it pleaſeth thee to ordain for this poor creature, and ſhall not be of their number, who ſubmit to thee by conſtraint, becauſe the winde carryes them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the celeſtial decrees, (who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſerve their puiſſance) draw them from above, and becauſe they underſtand, that in vain, they ſhould reſiſt thy invincible power, which tames and ſurmounts all things, wherefore (then) eſteeme I not my

            <p>Up, ariſe my ſoul, thou art here far off from perfection, fix not thy eyes longer on the earth, with-draw thy ſight from the miſeries of the world, efface them out of thy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy.</p>

            <p> Praiſe, praiſe, this Divine He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, which comes intimating the day of thy departing, that thou muſt ceaſe to live, and diſrobe thee of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: imitate the ſwans, who in dying, render their voyces moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, being the laſt day of their ſongs.</p>
            <p>Good God, I am without colour, without vigour, and without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſſe that which perturbations of minde cauſes; a thouſand cares gnaw my ſpirit, and a thouſand ſnares of ſolitude entangle in my cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hold me ſtraightly fixt to their ſorrowes: the ſame diſtemper, the ſame grief, equally labours my body and my ſoul.</p>
            <p>I miſerably languiſh in this poor carcaſſe, which ſurfeits on ſorrows, and ſavours of nothing but the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin: My ſoul is ſtuffed with ignorance and gloomineſſe, with ice and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 'tis ſtupid and heavy: but by thy grace, in one inſtant, ſhe will mount her ſelf into heaven, ſhe will be fil'd with ſplendour and light, ſhe ſhall be raviſh't in the contemplation of the beauty of thy Divinity, ſhe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170524:126"/>will be partaker of joyes not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and with contentments, the only contemplation whereof begets an ardent deſire in my will: ſhe ſhall adorn her brow with a wreath, the folyage whereof ſhall ever flouriſh, and never wither: ſhe ſhall bathe her ſelf in thy Divine ſpring, there to draw water, and drink, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent never to thirſt more; to the end, that that draught ſhould be made a fountain of living water in her, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into life eternal.</p>
            <p>O holy ſtream, Current of joy, and entyre delight, Eternal Source which never dryes up, that my ſoul might ever repoſe under thy ſhadow, that it might draw the ſweetneſſe of thine ayre, let her live in the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy perfections.</p>
            <p>This Lord, is the ardent deſire that inflames me, 'tis the only vow which poſſeſſeth my heart: the health of this body concernes me not, her greateſt age is not ſo much as one poynt to the price of the eternity of my ſoul, and then 'tis neceſſary to return to earth, to be faſhioned anew, that ſhe may dye in <hi>Adam,</hi> to be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170524:127"/>born again in Chriſt, that ſhe may deſcend into the grave, to come forth immortal; that ſhe muſt hide her ſelf under the earth, even to the day that thou comeſt to awaken on a ſudden, raiſing it up to glorifie it: until that great day, which ſhall ſurprize all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deſigns: Thou ſhalt make this All, to ſhiver at the ſound of the Trumpets of thine Angels, which ſhall Harp before the Saviour of the world, who ſhall gloriouſly deſcend from the vaults of heaven, all thoſe whom the Sea hath overwhelm'd, or the earth received: to the intent that being clothed with their bodyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Judge, they may receive their definitive ſentence of life or death.</p>
            <p>O Lord, that I may be of their number, who ſhall ariſe to their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and not of them who ſhall ariſe to their infamy: that I may be of them who ſhall rejoyce with perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Triumph, and not of thoſe who ſhall for ever remain ſlaves of that horrible Monſter.</p>
            <p>That I may be of that number that may be borne into the brightneſſe of

            <p>O good God, ſuffer not my Barke to fall into ſo cruel, ſo ſad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal a ſtorme!</p>
            <p>It ſhould be more expedient for me never to have been born, than be ranck't in the number of them who were created to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Bring to paſſe (then) at that great day, that my rotten coſſin may be liſted up, enlighten this extinguiſh't carcaſe, cauſe it to live and ſhine with my ſoul, make them to flouriſh together for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>I am nothing Lord, but a lump of mud, yet never the leſſe thy hands

Thy love makes no impreſſion farther than my lips, Thy Divine flame pierces not within my ſoul.</p>
            <p>But Lord, I have been waſhed with the water of holy Baptiſm, I have participated of thy Sacraments, I have received a ſeal, a token, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred teſtimony of my pardon.</p>
            <p>I have ſucked that powerful anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, that immortal Ambroſia, that heavenly nouriſhment which ſhall concerve me againſt the poyſon and venome of my ſinnes, and againſt the power of Satan.</p>

That their ſinnes are ſurmounted by thy grace, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thy goodneſſe is manifeſt in their ſalvation, that thou wilt not cut and prune off thy members, and reject thoſe whoſe names are written in thy book of life.</p>
            <p>It ſeems that I behold thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance turn'd toward them, ſtanding at thy right hand, and thy mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their abſolution, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe for heritage the Kingdome which was prepared for you, from the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>Methinks I behold them rejoycing and filling themſelves with ſplendour while thou art ſpeaking, beholding them tranſported by a ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful raviſhment, by an ardure full
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170524:129"/>of zeal for thee, and for thy glory, to remain there for ever.</p>
            <p>O good God, 'tis thither that we muſt direct all our vowes, and confine all the deſires of our ſoules; 'Tis the luſtre of that glorious and holy day that ſhould dazle our eyes, and not the riches of this world: 'Tis the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe extream bright and perfect beauties, which ſhould ever entertain our thoughts, and not the dark ſhadowes of our cares. Beſtir thee, (then) let's not longer ſtay on theſe earthly cares, which are ſo many ſpiritual Divorces and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
            <p>My Soul, entertain not other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, my heart have no other wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, my mouth pronounce no other name, than that of our Saviour, and thy ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Let's up, and anchor here our bark, in theſe fair deſires let's perfect this man, finiſh this body, let's forbear to corrupt and ulcerate our wounds, to encreaſe our woes, to open again our miſeries; that our dolors, that our convulſions, that our fleames, (if it ſeem good to them) hail us quick,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170524:129"/>and drag us alive to the Tomb: that our carcaſſes be conſum'd with wormes, that our bones may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't to duſt, it matters not, ſeeing that the Saviour of the world renders as poſſeſſors of the fruit of ſo ſignaland happy a victory, that he beſtowes on us, our ſhare and lot in his land, that he covers us with Lawrels and with Palmes.</p>
            <p>O God, this Crown is very high, 'tis above this aſpiring rock, whoſe way is narrow and uneven, incumber'd with thornes and bryars. I lye tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my Bed, I cannot pull up my feet, not raiſe my head above my bolſter: my carcaſſe is nothing but dung, and my Soul then corruption; I am laden with a counter-wait, which ever preſſeth me down, my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are bolts and ſhackles on my feet, which makes me ever ſtumble; The Devil places them near, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues to cloſe up the paſſage, to render the way dreadful, and to drive me to deſpair of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay good God! I muſt not require the endeavours of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170524:130"/>my attenuated legs, and my carcaſſe half benum'd to climb this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to pierce the thickneſſe of the clouds, and raiſe my ſelf even to the heighth.</p>
            <p>'Tis onely requiſite that I dive into the contrition of my heart, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my month: I need but lift up my eyes, and taiſe up my cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward the great Saviour of the World, who openeth his armes to tranſport me.</p>
            <p>O my Rock, thou art not then any longer hard for me to prevail with: Chriſt the object of my faith, Chriſt the only medicine who can cloſe and conſolidate my wounds: Chriſt, in whom I eſtabliſh all my preſent and future felicity.</p>
            <p>Chriſt my guide, and my Bare ſtar who muſt conduct me to the light of his enſign; he ſhall open to me the way, ſhall make my faith to ſurmount all deſpaires; he ſhall deliver me from theſe hindrances; he ſhall raiſe me up free, and conduct me even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven; making me mount by his divine degrees, and ſhall guide (by the might of his holy Spirit) my
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170524:130"/>bleſſed and happy ſoul into his high place, where the ſeaſons paſſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>I will leave (to him) this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. I will leave to him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this great work, the honour ſhall be to his blood, to his blood, the only vertue whereof ſhal fix &amp; eſtabliſh this handful of earth higher than the heavens; I already perceive the rayes of his divine grace, which begin to ſhine over my ſoul: I feel (in my ſelf) the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Away then all worldly cares, get you behind me, be packing, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach no more. You are nothing but corrupt water, but rottenneſſe, then infection, in reſpect of thoſe heavenly beauties, of thoſe odoriffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fragrant flowers, which caſt forth ſo ſweet a ſent, which ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth my ſpirit, and raviſheth me in the contemplation of them.</p>
            <p>But good God, pain and torment, cuts off my ſpeech, whilſt I implore thee, conſider my malady, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforces it ſelf, which redoubles its violence: It appears to me, that my
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170524:131"/>feavour is obſtinate to revenge (on my fleſh and on my bones) the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed againſt thee; the heat ſtifles me, the chilneſſe cauſeth the members of my feeble carcaſſe to ſhiver, to ſuſtain, and endure a thouſand torments; I can do no more but ſighth, and bemoan my ſelf, I languiſh all wounded, quite undone, and my vigour hourely waſts and decayes; I am thirſty, my mouth is dry, I can find nothing that can quench my infinite drought: my fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour takes away from me the reliſh of every thing, all liquors ſeem bitter, all food is againſt ſtomach, their very ſight is nautious, not ſo much as the thought, I ſwallow my ſpittle inſtead of all nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Alas Lord, I well perceive what will become of me, I cannot longer reſiſt the aſſaults of ſo many evils: all the ſuccours of the earth are too feeble to heal me, my countenance droops, its extinct, my members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to feel the rigour of death: I toſſe and tumble up and down, I ſtretch my ſelf, and am no more: I court a little repoſe, a little ſleep,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170524:131"/>but it flyes me, I can obtaine none.</p>
            <p>Alas, formerly my repoſe deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dropt ſo pleaſantly into my eyes! The night was accuſtomed to bury all my cares, to give truce to my labours, to encloſe all my torments, in a grateful ſlumber. I ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd my trouble untill the day, untill the Sun came to open mine eyes:</p>
            <p>But now Lord, I cannot with great difficulty, cloſe my eyes to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but inſtantly I waken my ſelf, affrighted with the terrour of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dreams, with a thouſand hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible viſions, which appear before me ſucceſſively. The ſilence of the night, which was ſo agreeable to me, at preſent redoubles my horrours: my eye-lids are inclined to watch perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, my infirmity increaſes dayly! its rigour and violence recovers new force every moment, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth me, the more it gains upon me.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou haſt made adverſity, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Amos;</hi> thou haſt created it, as ſaith <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170524:132"/>comes upon us but by thy juſt providence, as <hi>Job</hi> hath acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the extremity of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Alas, my God? thy judgments are perfect, I feel the effects of thy fury, the weight of thine Arme: I ſubmit and render my ſelf to thy mercy, cure not my evil by another, apply not remedies more ſharp than the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, have pity on my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>At leaſt, Lord, prevent that the tediouſneſſe of my pain diſcompoſe not, offend not, nor overturn my ſpirit: continue my judgment to me, to the intent that I may employ that little time which remaines to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and conſider thy graces, and to beg my pardon.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou haſt cauſed waters to flow out of the rock, and to refreſh thy people in the Deſart: cauſe to ſpring (out of my faith) a fountain to refreſh my ſcaldings, and to give intermiſſion to my evils, to the end, that my ſoul (fil'd with a divine zeal) may wholly raiſe up her ſelf to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and civert from this carcaſſe,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170524:132"/>the ſenſe of its miſeries.</p>
            <p>Lord, Lord, approach thee near to me, my voyce cannot convey my ſorrowes even to thy eares, and ſo my miſeries ſhall ſurpaſſe my plaints.</p>
            <p>Lord, from thy Royal Palace, from thy holy and ſacred Throne thou conſidereſt all that is acted here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Alas, incline thy countenance to my aid &amp; aſſiſtance; redouble not more the extremities of my feavour, augment not my ſufferings, I underſtand good God, that by the deſtruction of this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe my Soul muſt enter into its felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but cauſe what remains to diſſolve eaſily, cauſe that my natural faculties diminiſh by degrees: and that my Soul may depart gently, and, from the midſt of this bed, ſhe may fly to thee.</p>
            <p>Lord, my breath is ſo ſhort, my infirmity is ſo violent, my diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſo near, that I behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſhadow of my Coffin, and the depth of my grave which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends me. My half dead body, makes me utter interrupted ſpeeches, my words vaniſh in my mouth, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue my complaints, I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170524:133"/>cannot make an end.</p>
            <p>Alas, good God, I fear that my voyce will forſake me, ſtrengthen me for awhile, or at leaſt be ſo gracious, that in my Soul I may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my faults, and obtain thy pardon.</p>
            <p>Grant me, (that the ſhort time I have to live) may be nothing elſe but a penitence for my ſinnes, and a meditation of thy goodneſſe: that I may not delight but in the ſound of thy voice, that thy holy volume may be in lieu of a pillow: that my heart, that my ſpirit may breath forth and contemplate thy praiſes.</p>
            <p>Lord, my diſtemper is ſo violent, that it ſuffocates me, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it oppreſſeth me not ſo much as the vaſt number of my ſinnes, which I obſerve haſting before me, and the puniſhment that followes.</p>
            <p>I tremble, when I turn my eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee, great God, revenger of iniquities, which enlightneth and pierceth through the ſhadowes, and remarkeſt the tracts of all my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Thou beholdeſt my conſcience without any vail, without ornament,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170524:133"/>all my cognitations are open to thee, the paſt and preſent are both alike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, thou readeſt during the courſe of my life, the train of my offences that I have committed, thou beholdeſt thy enemy in my habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou findeſt him incloſed in my boſome.</p>
            <p>My voyce ſhould ever ſound in thy eares, it ought inceſſantly to cauſe thy praiſes to eccho upon the earth: (on the contrary) my mouth hath ever been open to blaſphemies, cloſed to thy Word.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt given me a ſpirit to know thee, a heart to adore thee, hands to ſtretch forth to the ſupport and relief of my neighbour: I am revolted from thee, I have deſpiſed the afflicted, and have avoided the path of the poor and needy, fearing their ran-counter, I have avoided their company, as if I had dreaded to behold them.</p>
            <p>When thy heaven hath thundred, I have ſtopt my eares, I have rendred my ſelf deaf.</p>
            <p>When thy Sun hath caſt forth his beames upon me, I have made my
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170524:134"/>ſelf blind: when thou haſt ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, I have fled away, when thou haſt called me, I have not anſwered, when thou haſt corrected, I have been hardned at thy ſtroakes; Inlieu of ſacrifiſing my life for thine honour, I have continually betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſervice: I am abandoned to vices, I have ſerv'd riches, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and vanities of the world, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of my life.</p>
            <p>I have been immoderate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive in every thing which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to thy pleaſure, without having other bound than an imbicility to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance farther.</p>
            <p>My memory Lord, is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to comprehend and enumerate ſuch a multitude of crimes; and I now have more baſhfulneſſe to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them, than I had ſhame to act them.</p>
            <p>Alſo Lord, what need the trouble to recount them, ſeeing they preſent themſelves, they oppoſe themſelves againſt me, accuſing and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: ſeeing that the leaſt, but lately committed, is ſufficient for my damnation, without the trouble
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170524:134"/>to ſearch after the paſt, which ſerve not but for aſtoniſhment, how the nature of man could invent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo many miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>Behold them, Lord; they fail not to paſſe into my remembrance, and as an heavy burthen, preſſe me ſo ſore, that I am ready to yield, to give my ſelf up to diſpayre, and to loſe my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Lord, I cannot ſo much as deny them, I have committed them, they were acted in thy ſight, in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: with a feeble, fearful, and aſtoniſh't voyce, I acknowledge them, and am vanquiſh't: the fear that I have (beholding their great number) hath frozen my heart, and appaled my countenance.</p>
            <p>And (on the contrary) conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rigour and ſtrictneſſe of thy judgments, my ſenſe fails me, and I attend nothing but the hour of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>I will willingly lye down inſtantly (half quick in my grave) and in expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, draw the earth over me, to the intent I may remove my ſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Juſtice, ſo much do I dread
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170524:135"/>that thy hand will wax heavy againſt me to deſtroy me.</p>
            <p>I am like the poor <hi>Publican,</hi> who durſt not lift up his eyes towards thee, I dare not ſo much as entertain any imagination of remiſſion for a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſo culpable; I diſpayre to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them, even as undergoing the exemplar-puniſhment of my abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practiſes: The depravity of my manners, renders the ſeverity of thy cenſures ſharp againſt me: and I know that no man hath place in thy eternal felicity, but thoſe that are clenſed from ſin, who are not fully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſpots of iniquity, who have ſubmitted and dedicated (to thy ſervice) their hearts and their toungs: as for me I have done quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, Lord, thou wilt not bruiſe in thine indignation thoſe whom thou haſt created after thine own Image.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt not precipitate into the gulf, and forſake (abandoned to the roring Lyon) thoſe who are graffed and regenerated in that great Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, in the grand Saviour of the world.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:170524:135"/>
            <p> On the contrary, Good God! Thou haſt commanded us to pray to thee in his name, Thou haſt promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear us in his name, Thou haſt aſſured us that when our ſins are as red as vermillion, nevertheleſs thou wilt make them as white as wool, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have recourſe to that Treaſure of our Juſtification, to that only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to that only Authour of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now, O Saviour of the world, O Precious Stone, O Spirit of my Spirits, I embrace thee, I diſcharge the burthen of my ſins upon thee, I eaſe my ſelf upon thee.</p>
            <p>Thou art purpoſly deſcended here below, thou art clothed with out fleſh, thou haſt made thy ſelf man, to the intent that I might be able to ſpeak to thee: Thou haſt ſtretc'h forth thy limbs on the Croſſe, thou haſt ſhed thy blood, thou haft ſeen it diſtil from thy wounds all vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, to heal my mortal ſores, to dround my ſinnes, to cloath me again with innocence: Thou haſt ſuffered death, to give me the life.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt made thy ſelf the oblation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170524:136"/>and moſt immaculate offering, to take upon thy ſelf the pains which I have meritted: Thou haſt yielded thy ſelf captive to ſet me at liberty, of immortal, thou haſt made thy ſelf mortal, to the intent that of mortal, to render me immortal: Thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ever flouriſheth, that never wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth old, diſplay it over me, approach, touch my ſins, and they ſhall diſſolve away as wax before the beames of thy Sun, they cannot remain near thee, thy ſight ſhall be their flight, thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence their diſſipation: Thou ſhalt efface their ſteps, and their ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
            <p>Thy hand can bruiſe the gate of hell, thy hand can lift me up into the heavens, and make me to aſcend by the ladder that appeared to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord, I cannot ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thy infinite goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perſons ſo vile and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
            <p>If I contemplate the excellence of thy Divinity, in thy deſcent unto the earth, or whether I conſider them to whom thou art come, I admire
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170524:136"/>the Grandure of thy charity: and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ruminating thereon, I call to mind the happineſſe of thy humane condition: The Creatour of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of earth, The Omnipotent, who is not diſpleas'd, but with man, is deſcended for man, and made himſelf man: is come to ſave him from the torture of the fire, and the horrors of hell, and hath taken his forme: the Phyſitian is haſted to the ſuccour of the diſeaſed, the Maſter to ranſome the ſlaves, the ſtreight path preſents it ſelf to the ſtraglers; Life of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf to the carcaſſes encloſed under the Tombs; the Shepheard is deſcended from the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to ſeek the ſtraying ſheep; He hath again lifted them up on high, and encloſ'd them in his Fold: The Hen hath gathered her chickings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her breaſt, hath made a ſhield with her wings, to protect them from the Ravenous Kite.</p>
            <p>Now, good God, drive far from me thoſe doubts which Satan goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to frame in me, aſſure me, comfort my ſpirit, fortifie my faith, redouble it's ſtrength, make her to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170524:137"/>vanquiſh all fears, all the diſpayres which he would ſuggeſt unto her: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able her to repel all allutements and aſſaults of all his temptations: She muſt not longer be affraid, ſhe may not longer tremble, hell can have nothing againſt me, ſeeing thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne hath taken my ſinnes upon him, becauſe he hath waſh't me with his pure blood; after it hath pleas'd thee to allow (on mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) the value of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>If thou art pleas'd Lord, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with me according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, I ſhould be far diſtant from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch happineſſe, my ſalvation would be deſperate: There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any contention with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion, the weapons are too unequal, my fault is extreame, ſo is thy Juſtice; But Lord, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is infinite, thy goodneſs ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth my mallice, Thou covereſt my faults with the body of thy Son, by his merit thou haſt ſatisfied thy Juſtice: Thou haſt given me life, there thou concerveſt me, I hold of thy clemency.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170524:137"/>
            <p> Lord, Thou haſt ſpoken (by the mouth of thy Prophets,) that thou art nigh to ſuch as are of a broken heart, and that thou delivereſt ſuch which have contrite ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou contemneſt not the afflicted, thou hideſt not thy face from them, forget not then my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: forget not my afflictions, which are violent and permanent: forget not the ſorrowes of my heart which are augmented.</p>
            <p>Lord, my Soul is conſumed, even to the duſt; my belly cleaves to the earth: Hear then, my God, myclamour, and my ſupplication, and forbear to aggravate my torments: regard my afflictions and my travel, and forgive me all my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Lord, I ſuffer in my groanings, I mingle my Couch with my tears, I am pierc't with afflictions on the bed of languiſhing: The earth is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to deliver me out of this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; The heavens alone have the glory of the medicines that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for me. Make haſt then to come to my deliverance, my God, who
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170524:138"/>doth dayly comfort me in my diſtreſſe, and ſhelter me in all my ſtormes.</p>
            <p>Lord, I am afflicted that I cannot depart, more than that I cannot live: But, good God, who haſt freed from death the great Shepheard of the flock, by the blood of the perpetual Covenant, turn thy compallionate countenance towards my torment, and cauſe it to ſhine upon me in joy and in ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou haſt inſtructed me to underſtand my end, and what is the wretchedneſſe of my dayes. But good God, ſince thou haſt ordain'd that I muſt die, cauſe me to depart in thee, that Imay live again; I have ſinned, my God, I have diſpleaſed thee, I have a thouſand and a thouſand times every day provoked thy fury, but thou art the God of my deliverance: I am waſht, I am ſanctifi'd, I am juſtified by thy grace in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; who hath taken my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes upon him, and charged my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences upon himſelf. I am a fellow-Citizen of the Saints, of thy Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: I am built upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170524:138"/>of the Prophets and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>Pardon then my ſinnes, Lord, in the name of thy well-beloved Son, correct me not in thy diſpleaſure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaſten me in thy fury; have mercy on me that am deſtitute of ſtrength.</p>
            <p>I beſeech thee my God, in the bitterneſſe of my Soul, in the words of the Propher <hi>David. Lord, heare my request, and make my ſupplication come unto thee: Hide not thy face from me in the time that I am in cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, encline thine ear unto me in the day that I cry unto thee, haſt thee to anſwer me: for my bones are dryed as an hearth, and they cleave to my fleſh by reaſon of my groaning; and my time vaniſheth away like ſmoke, and as a ſhadow which paſſeth away, and as for me, I am become withered as the graſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lord, I ſaid once again with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Eternal, reprove me not in thine indignation, thine arrowes have pierc't me, and thy hand hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd me: there is no entire part in my fleſh, there is no reſt in my
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170524:139"/>bones, by reaſon of my ſinne, for mine iniquities are gone over my head, and are too weighty, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthen above my ſtrength; I am bowed down, and ſwerve beyond meaſure: I am weakned and bruiſed more and more.</p>
            <p>Lord, all my deſires are before thee, and my afflictions are not hid from thee. Forſake me not my God, be not far from me, haſt thee and help me. All my hope is in thy mercy.</p>
            <p>Lord, thou haſt ſpoken by the mouth of thy Prophet <hi>Eſay, I have heard thee in an acceptable ſeaſon, and ſuccoured thee in the day of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> My God, now behold the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, ſee now the day of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be thou now Lord, my Rock, and my Fortreſſe, be thou my Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and ſure Retrait. The ſnares of death hath ſurpriz'd me, deſtruction hath environ'd me, but I lift up my ſelf to thee my God: hearken to my ſupplication from thy holy place, and let my cry enter into thine ears.</p>
            <p>Give me by thy free mercy the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and entire reward, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170524:139"/>that I entred not into thy Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard till at the cloſe of the day: ſhew me thy ſight, give me life eternal after this fleeting, languiſhing and cranſitory life, and aſſure me of heaven, to the intent that the grave ſwallow me not up for ever.</p>
            <p>Grant me, my God, that when the Saviour of the World ſhall appear, I may appear with him in glory.</p>
            <p>Grant me that I may accompany that infinite number of thine, which ſhall be before the Throne cloathed in long white Robes, holding Palms in their hands, and that I ſing with a loud voyce with them, ſalvation is of our God, who is ſet upon the Throne, and of the Lamb. Waſh my garment, and cleanſe it in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood; to the end, that I may eternally ſerve thee in his holy Temple, wherein I ſhall never ſuffer hunger nor thirſt, that I be no more moleſted nor diſtemper'd with the Sun, nor with the Winter, nor with miſeries; my tears and my pains wip't away with thy hand.</p>
            <p>O Lord, I am at the laſt gaſp of my life, in the agony and ſhadow of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170524:140"/>death; to thee I direct my lateſt vowes, my laſt words: All my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have not been better than vanity, in reſpect hereof.</p>
            <p>Good God, arme not thy ſelf with vengeance againſt me, I render to thee my penitent Soul, deploring, languiſhing, which ſavours of nought but earth and duſt, to which this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe ſhall be incontinently reduc't. I oppoſe my cryes, my tears, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, my plaints, and my groans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my condemnation and my fall. Let the confeſſion of my mouth, the contrition of my heart cauſe thy Sword to tumble out of thy hands; let my gaſping move thy goodneſſe, magnifie not thy power and might againſt a languiſhing, attenuated, immoveable carcaſſe: againſt withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red graſſe, laid on the earth, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nought but to be driven away by the ſmalleſt blaſt: I am at my end, I neither have more power nor heart to offend thee: but I may ſtill ſerve thee, to publiſh thy elemency, the foundation of my hope, and thy bounty, the ſpring of my life. I am thine from the Cradle, thou haſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170524:140"/>me: I have been redeem'd and ranſom'd by the blood of thy Son, who died innocent to give life to the guilty: by the blood of thy Son, who muſt open to me the door of felicity. I have my recourſe to him, I beſeech thee in his Name: It is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that my ſinnes ſhould violate me in ſo holy a Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Rouſe thee good God, a riſe ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the extremity of my affliction will not admit any delay: to the end that theſe ſinnes, be not too powerful for me: hearken to my prayers, give me ſtrength to prevail againſt theſe bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that drive me off from the heavenly ſhoar; haſt thee to abſolve me: preſerve (in thy hands) my Soul, leſt it remain a prey: drive theſe ſins our of thy preſence, which are the work of thine enemy, and Lord pardon me, that am the work of thine hands.</p>
            <p>Lord, I render praiſe for that thou haſt made me capable to participate of the heritage of Saints in thy light: for that thou haſt delivered me from the power of darkneſſe, and haſt tranſported me to the Kingdome of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170524:141"/>thy well-beloved Son, in whom I have deliverance, and remiſſion from my ſins.</p>
            <p>Lord, I perceive the eſtabliſhment of thine aſſiſtance, I feel my ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh't with thy Holy Spirit, who effaces my tranſgreſſions, and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Soul even unto heaven, to ſhew him the inheritance which the mercy of thy Son hath beſtowed on me, in thy preſence.</p>
            <p>O good God! how bleſſed ſhall I be to hear from thy Holy Spirit, that the laſt of my dayes, ſhall be the firſt of my repoſe, that I am not farther from my ſatisfaction, than the length of the laſt groan of my life. I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Lord, to thy Throne of grace with aſſurance, to obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the vertue of my High Prieſt, who hath compaſſion on my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I am coming to behold thee face to face, whereas now I diſcern thee but darkly, as in a mirrour: I am quitting theſe miſeries, for a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of delight; from theſe dolors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mountain of <hi>Syon;</hi> from this Militant, to the Triumphant <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> from this World, to the City of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170524:141"/>the living God. I voluntarily ceaſe to live on the Earth, to ſurvive in heaven; I contentedly part with this wretched life, for that which is moſt happy: I chearfully quit my ſelf to follow thee, I abandon this carcaſſe, and render my Soul into thy hands.</p>
